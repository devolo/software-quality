# devolo Software Quality

Creating high-quality, well-reviewed, and properly tested software has a high priority for all devolo developers. Our firmware drives millions of devices in many parts of the world, and failures could have catastrophic effects on critical infrastructure for countless organisations and individuals.

To ensure the high quality of our products, devolo software is subject to world-class quality assurance measures, including but not limited to

* Unit tests on development machines and target hardware
* Static analysis
* Dynamic analysis (e. g. address sanitization)
* Fuzz tests
* Automatic tests on Continuous Integration servers
* Code reviews
* Manual tests on target hardware

Mastery of software development tools, in particular of the programming languages used, is of paramount importance. Developers are continually trained and educated in their craft, because as a software developer, your knowledge is never complete.

The devolo C/C++ Coding Guidelines, available in this repo, were compiled by senior developers with decades of pracical experience in close cooperation with the development teams. They reflect best practice, document existing coding style, guide future development, and serve as a basis for code reviews.
